# Cassini
Using a splitView i had 3 clickable links on the front interface. 
Once one of the links was clicked it went to a picture of either earth,
Cassini, or Saturn. It fetched the pictures off of the main queue so it 
didnt tie down the use of the app or device. I used scrollView to be able to 
zoom in and out of the pictures. Also added a spinner wheel for when the image was loading.
